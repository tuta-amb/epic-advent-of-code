advent of code is pretty epik ngl

here are my solutions written in typescript with deno
they're probably kinda bad but idc

also if you're wondering why i have so many `as`-es:

- a) im bad a ts
- b) ts has no idea about input data

# todo
- add tests with sample data | done

# running
you can run them like this:
```bash
> cat input.txt | deno run 2023/01.ts
...answer...
```
or use the tester with built in data
```bash
> deno run 2023/XX
...runs all in 2023...
> deno run 2023/01 2023/02
...runs 2023/01.ts and 2023/02.ts...
```

# notes
- 2023/04 part 2 doesn't work, prob won't fix idk
